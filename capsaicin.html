          Anytime you eat something spicy and your tongue starts to “burn,” capsaicin is to blame. It’s the active component of plants in the genus Capsicum, which includes chili peppers.<br>

          When capsaicin touches any human tissue, such as that of the tongue, it creates a burning sensation. This burning is due to the nerve stimulus that capsaicin sends to the brain, a combination of warmth and intense stimulus. Because of this, “spicy” is not actually a taste — it isn’t felt by the tongue’s taste receptors but rather the tongue’s pain receptors.<br>

          But the burning sensation isn’t the same for everyone. It all depends on how sensitive the receptors are. If you eat spicy food very often, and expose the receptors to a lot of capsaicin, you can decrease their sensitivity and, therefore, increase your spice tolerance. And spice tolerance can also be inherited, when certain receptors that would ordinarily send signals of “burning” are mutated.<br>

          And when you feel the burn (of the capsaicin), it’s unwise to reach for water. Capsaicin is hydrophobic, which means that, due to its molecular structure, it is naturally repelled by water. It’s also nonpolar, due to relatively equal electronegativities of its molecular components. Its intermolecular forces are not similar to those of water, which is a polar molecule. As a result, capsaicin isn’t water soluble, and instead spreads the capsaicin throughout the mouth. In contrast, dairy products, such as milk, are characterized by nonpolar molecules. They are much better at dissolving the capsaicin and relieving the spicy sensation. So next time you eat something spicy, reach for milk instead of water.<br>
